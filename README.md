# Electrical-Symbol-recognition-and-Wiring-design
Electrical Symbol Recognition and Wiring Design is the process of automating the identification of electrical symbols in schematic diagrams and designing efficient wiring layouts based on these symbols. This integration of computer vision, machine learning, and algorithmic techniques improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and optimizes the design of electrical systems.

Key Aspects
1. Symbol Recognition
Identifies and classifies standard electrical symbols, such as switches, lights, outlets, and panels, in 2D diagrams or blueprints.
Leverages techniques like deep learning (e.g., YOLO) and advanced image processing for robust symbol detection.

3. Wiring Design
Employs algorithms like A* for pathfinding and obstacle detection, ensuring optimal wiring routes and layout efficiency.

5. Applications
Automates electrical plan verification, ensuring compliance with design standards.
Assists designers in generating efficient, error-free wiring layouts.
Improves the reliability and speed of electrical system design, reducing manual errors.

Impact
This approach seamlessly integrates symbol recognition with actionable wiring recommendations, promoting advancements in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and smart design workflows. It represents a significant step toward fully automated electrical design processes, contributing to increased efficiency and innovation in the industry.
